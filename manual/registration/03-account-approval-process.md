# Account Approval Process

After you submit the vendor registration form, your application goes into review.

## What happens next

1. An administrator reviews your registration details.
2. If approved, you will receive an email with a password setup link.
3. Set your password to activate your account.

## Status and timing

- Approval time depends on the administrator's review queue.
- You cannot log in until your account is approved and your password is set.

## If you are not approved

If your application is rejected or needs changes, the administrator may contact you for updates.
Once the required changes are provided, the review will continue.

## Need help?

If you have not received an approval email after a reasonable time, contact the administrator or SwatHub support.
