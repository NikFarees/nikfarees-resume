# Common Registration Issues

Below are common problems vendors face during registration and how to resolve them.

## I did not receive the approval email

- Check your spam or junk folder.
- Confirm you registered with the correct email address.
- Contact the administrator if you still do not receive the email.

## I cannot log in after approval

- Make sure you have completed the password setup from the email link.
- Try resetting your password if you forgot it.
- If the issue persists, contact the administrator.

## The registration form will not submit

- Ensure all required fields are filled out.
- Check that your email format is valid.
- Refresh the page and try again.

## My account is pending for too long

Approval time depends on the administrator's review queue.
If it has been more than a reasonable time, reach out to the administrator for a status update.

## Need help?

If none of the above fixes work, contact SwatHub support or the system administrator.
