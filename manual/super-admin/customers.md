# Customers

## What this manages
Customer organizations, their contacts, regions, and operational context for Service Orders.

## Where to find it

## Key fields to review
- Name and External Code: legal name and any ERP/CRM identifiers.
- Billing Details: billing contact, terms, and tax information (if configured).
- Regions / Sites: which regions the customer operates in.
- Primary Contacts: key business and site contacts (see Agents).

## Common actions
1) Create a customer
- Click **Create Customer**.
- Enter **Name**, **External Code** (if used), and primary contact details.
- Assign **Regions** and any default billing settings.
- Save, then add **Agents** and **Equipment** as needed.
