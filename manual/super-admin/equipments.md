# Site Equipment

## What this manages
Equipment/assets at customer sites that may appear on Service Orders and technician work.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Customers → Site Equipment.

## Key fields to review
- Customer and Site/Location: where the equipment resides.
- Asset Identifiers: name, model, serial number, tag/asset ID.
- Category/Type: equipment classification for reporting and technician skill matching.
- Warranty / Contract Dates: coverage windows (if tracked).
- Status: active/inactive.

## Common actions
1) Add equipment
- Click **Create Equipment**.
- Select **Customer** and **Site** (if applicable).
- Enter identifiers (model, serial, asset tag) and category.
- Add warranty or contract dates if used for billing/coverage checks.
- Save. The asset becomes selectable on Service Orders.

2) Update or retire equipment
- Edit details as needed; set **Inactive** when decommissioned to preserve history.

## Best practices
- Keep asset tags unique per customer.
- Capture serial and model for manufacturer support and parts ordering.
- When retiring equipment, inactivate rather than delete so historical Service Orders stay linked.
