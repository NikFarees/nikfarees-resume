# Pricing Overrides

## What this manages
Exceptions to standard Pricing Tables for specific customers, regions, branches, or scenarios.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Pricing Table → Pricing Table Overrides.

## Key fields to review
- Target Scope: customer, region, vendor branch, or combination.
- Catalog Item or Category: the item being overridden.
- Rate Type: fixed price, discount, markup, or custom rate.
- Effective Dates: start and end dates to control validity.
- Notes/Justification: why the override exists.

## Common actions
1) Create an override
- Click **Create Pricing Override**.
- Choose the **Target Scope** (customer/region/vendor).
- Select the **Catalog Item/Category** and set the override rate or discount.
- Set **Effective Dates** to avoid open-ended overrides.
- Save. The override applies when matching scope conditions are met.

2) Update or expire
- Edit the override to adjust rates or extend dates.
- To retire, set an end date or toggle **Inactive** if available.

## Best practices
- Prefer scoped overrides over duplicating Pricing Tables.
- Always set end dates for temporary discounts.
- Document justification in the notes field for auditability.
