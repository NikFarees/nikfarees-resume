# Service Orders

## What this manages
End-to-end work orders, from creation and assignment through completion and billing.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Orders → Service Orders.

## Key fields to review
- Customer, Site, and Region: where work occurs.
- Priority and SLA: governs scheduling and response targets.
- Status: New, Assigned, In Progress, Completed, Canceled (labels may vary by environment).
- Assigned Vendor/Technician/Team: who performs the work.
- Catalog Items/Lines: billable labor/parts linked to pricing.
- Attachments/Notes: supporting documents and updates.

## Common actions
1) Create a service order
- Click **Create Service Order**.
- Select **Customer**, **Site/Region**, **Priority/SLA**, and describe the issue.
- Optionally attach **Equipment** and **Agent** contacts.
- Save, then assign a **Vendor**, **Technician**, or **Team**.

2) Assign work
- From the order view, choose **Assign Vendor** or **Assign Technician/Team**.
- Ensure the assignee covers the region and required skills.

3) Track progress
- Update **Status** as work advances.
- Add **Notes** and **Attachments** for field updates.
- Add **Catalog Items/Lines** for labor/materials; pricing pulls from the active table and overrides.

4) Close the order
- Confirm all work logs and materials are captured.
- Set **Completed** (or equivalent) and ensure any closure fields (signatures, photos) are present.

## Best practices
- Attach relevant equipment and agent to reduce back-and-forth with the customer.
- Use priorities consistently to drive dispatching.
- Keep assignment history intact; reassign instead of deleting assignments.
