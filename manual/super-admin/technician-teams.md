# Technician Teams

## What this manages
Groups of technicians for assignment, scheduling, and coverage management.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Technicians → Technician Teams.

## Key fields to review
- Team Name and Code: unique identifiers.
- Region/Coverage: areas the team supports.
- Team Lead: primary contact for escalations.
- Members: technicians assigned to the team.

## Common actions
1) Create a team
- Click **Create Technician Team**.
- Set **Name/Code**, **Region/Coverage**, and **Team Lead**.
- Add **Members**.
- Save. The team becomes available for Service Order assignment.

2) Maintain membership
- Edit the team to add or remove members; ensure coverage is maintained when changing regions.

3) Inactivate a team
- Set to **Inactive** when disbanded; this preserves historical assignments.

## Best practices
- Keep teams region-specific to simplify dispatch.
- Ensure every active team has a lead for communication.
- Avoid overlapping teams with identical membership unless needed for scheduling rules.
