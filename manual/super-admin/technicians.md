# Technicians

## What this manages
Individual technicians, their contact details, skills, and regional coverage.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Technicians → Technicians.

## Key fields to review
- Name and Contact: phone/email for dispatch.
- Vendor/Company: employment or contracting entity.
- Regions: areas the technician serves.
- Skills/Certifications: used for matching to Service Orders.
- Status: active/inactive.

## Common actions
1) Add a technician
- Click **Create Technician**.
- Enter contact details, assign **Vendor/Company** and **Regions**.
- Add **Skills/Certifications** if configured.
- Save. The technician becomes assignable to Service Orders and Teams.

2) Update profile
- Edit regions, skills, or contact info as needed.

3) Inactivate
