# Users

## What this manages
System user accounts and role assignments across Super Admin, Admin, Vendor Admin, and Vendor Staff roles.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Settings → Users.

## Key fields to review
- Name, Email, Phone: identity and contact.
- Role: determines system permissions.
- Status: active/inactive; inactive users cannot sign in.
- Associated Vendor/Company (for vendor roles): restricts data access scope.

## Common actions
1) Create a user
- Click **Create User**.
- Enter **Name**, **Email**, and optional phone.
- Assign the **Role** and, for vendor roles, the **Vendor/Company** scope.
- Save and send credentials/reset link per your security policy.

2) Reset access
- Use password reset or force logout if the account is compromised.

3) Deactivate
- Set **Inactive** for departed users; do not delete to preserve audit history.

## Best practices
- Use business email addresses; avoid shared inboxes.
- Grant least-privilege roles; reserve Super Admin for platform owners.
- Regularly review inactive accounts and vendor scopes.
