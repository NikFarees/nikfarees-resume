# Vendor Access

## What this manages
Access control and onboarding for vendor-side users and branches.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Service Partners → Vendor Access (name may vary: "Vendor Access" or "Vendor Branch Access").

## Key fields to review
- Vendor Company / Branch: scope of the access being granted.
- User and Role: which vendor user and their role (Vendor Admin or Vendor Staff).
- Status: pending, active, revoked.
- Expiry or Validity: optional end date for temporary access.

## Common actions
1) Grant access
- Click **Create Vendor Access**.
- Select **Vendor Company/Branch** and the **User** (or invite a new user if supported).
- Assign **Role** and set validity dates if needed.
- Save. The user gains access scoped to the selected vendor entity.

2) Revoke or suspend
- Edit the record and set **Status** to revoked/inactive or set an immediate end date.

3) Update scope
- Move a user to a different branch/company by editing the access record; confirm they should lose prior scope.

## Best practices
- Keep vendor users scoped to the minimal branch they need.
- Use expiry dates for temporary contractors.
- Review active vendor access regularly, especially after contract changes.
