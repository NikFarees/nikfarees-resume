# Vendors

## What this manages
Vendor organizations and branches that fulfill Service Orders.

## Where to find it
Admin Panel → Service Partners → Vendors (and related Vendor Companies/Branches if separated in your menu).

## Key fields to review
- Vendor Name and Code: legal and short identifiers.
- Branches/Locations: operational sites that can receive assignments.
- Regions Served: areas covered by the vendor or branch.
- Primary Contacts: operations and billing contacts.
- Status: active/inactive.

## Common actions
1) Add a vendor
- Click **Create Vendor**.
- Enter **Name/Code**, contact info, and regions served.
- Add **Branches** (if modeled separately) with addresses and coverage.
- Save, then create **Vendor Access** for their users.

2) Update coverage or contacts
- Edit vendor or branch records to adjust regions and primary contacts.

3) Inactivate
- Set vendor or branch to **Inactive** to stop new assignments while keeping history.

## Best practices
- Align vendor regions with technician coverage to avoid unserviceable orders.
- Keep a billing contact per vendor for pricing and invoicing alignment.
- Review branch data periodically; stale branches cause assignment confusion.
