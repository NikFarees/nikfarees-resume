# Vendor Admin - Vendor Branches

## Purpose

2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter branch details (name, address, contact info).
4. Save.

## Assign staff to branches
- After creating a branch, add staff members to the branch from the **Users** section.
- Only staff assigned to a branch can be scheduled for work at that branch.

## Tips

- Use a single primary contact for each branch.
